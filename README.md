# appointy-nikhil-kapu-test
 This repo contains the code for a Webpage as part of the appointy interview process. The page is live at https://nikhil-kapu.github.io/appointy-nikhil-kapu-test/(The appointy logo file-Appointy-Logo1.svg from Res doesnt seem to be working on this live page, However, it does work locally on computer.)
 
 Thank You
 Hope you like this, I've been working on it since yesterday's webinar.
